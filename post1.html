    <h1>How I Started Web Development</h1>
    <p class="date">August 2025</p>
    <p>
      My journey into web development started with curiosity about how websites work. 
      I began learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating small projects like a clock, to-do list, 
      and even a personal portfolio website.

      Over time, I realized consistency is key, and practicing daily helped me grow. 
      Now Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and eventually become a full stack developer ðŸš€.
